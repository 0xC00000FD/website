# JSFAR Website!
It's about time we made a website custom to our style and independent of a free 3rd-party service like Enjin. Thus, this project will aim to build, from the Ground up a new website with all the useful functionality usually offered by Enjin and MORE!
The great thing about making our own website from the groun up is that we get to choose how things work and how things look. Even if it means building it ourselves.

## Project Management
The Task, Suggestions and Feedback Management will all be handled on Trello. We will use Trello for the reasons of it being:
1. Easy to use
2. Allows Members to offer feedback and suggestions via commenting on and Up-voting individual tasks
  - Comment to add feedback and make suggestions for an individual task
    + e.g. on task "Implement Google Calendar" a Member could say "I hate Google Calendar, don't use it!" thus adding their voice to how the Website will be created
  - Up-vote to show the Developers which Feature should be prioritised!
