								</header>
								<p>Complete <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/bUmrnDCxjXCTndHg1" title="Google Forms Application form">this application form</a>.</p>
								<p>Once we have receied your application, command will then consider your application. If your application is found to be satisfactory, a member of staff will then be in contact with you to schedule a voice meeting.</p>
								<p>This meeting will take place on our <a href="ts3server://ts.jsfar.com">Teamspeak</a> server with Platoon leaders present. The intention of this meeting is to get a better idea about you, what your values are, what kind of a person you are, and whether or not you would be the right fit for the unit.</p>
								<p>If you successfully make it past the above two stages, you will be asked (unless you have already done so at this point) to join the <a href="http://bit.ly/jsfar-join-discord" title="This server is a whole lot of fun, so join it anyway!">JSFAR Discord server</a> and to "Apply" to the <a href="http://bit.ly/jsfar-arma-3-units" title="This requires that you create a Bohemia Interactive account and that you link this account with your Steam Account">Arma 3 Units page</a> to collect the unit patch which we wear whenever we play.</p>
								<p>You will then attend basic training and once you've passed this training, you will then be a fully fledged member of the JSFAR!</p>
