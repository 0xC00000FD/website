								<h2>Intro</h2>
							</header>
							<p><strong>The 7th Air Assault Brigade (7AA) is multi-national ArmA 3 Tactical Realism group; a gaming community built around Bohemia Interactive's ArmA 3. 
							The 7AA is based on the British 16th AAB, the Army's rapid response airborne formation, operating in the ERA of 2035. 
							The 7th Air Assault Brigade is commonly deployed in politically sensitive and/or destabilised regions for classified reconnaissance operations.

								<h2>Biography</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							The brigade operates as light armoured infantry supported by light combat air assets and light armoured vehicles for a rapid deployment. 
							The infantry of the brigade have all been trained up to SPEC OPS standards. Therefore, the 7AA's main MO are highly sensitive objectives, received from the Joint NATO Command Centre in Europe. 
							This SPEC OPS infantry receives support from the Fire Support Group, the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Signals Squadrons. 
							Together they make a lethal combination on the ground. During a full out war or a classified operation behind enemy lines, the 7AA can handle it all. 
							As a rapid respone airborne formation, it is one of the few brigades capable of delivering Airborne operations.</p>
